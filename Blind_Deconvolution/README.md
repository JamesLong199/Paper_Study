# ECE 273 Convex Optimization Project

# Objective
Study the blind deconvolution paper by [Ahmed et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5608), summarize the problem formulation, methods and techniques, and recreate results published in the paper.

# Convex Optimization Solver
[CVXPY library](https://www.cvxpy.org/) is used for solving convex optimization problem in the experiments.

# Project Report
All discussion of the above objective is included in the [project report](https://github.com/JamesLong199/Paper_Study/blob/main/Blind_Deconvolution/Project_Report.pdf)
